# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
First fork a respository on the cloud (github) and then add that SSH address to a location using the terminal to place it. To add to github from local, launch a new repository on github and then add the code in the terminal to link and then push the local repository to the cloud.
